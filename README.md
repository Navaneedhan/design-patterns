# Design patterns
As a software developer, he/she don't need to solve all the problems that they face in their day to day work.
Most of the problems were solved or have solutions which were obtained by numerious other software developers over quite a substantial period of time.
Those solutions evolve as the patterns and can be reused and they are collectively called as "design patterns"
